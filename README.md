## Struggles
My biggest struggle for this assignment was my node-modules messing up, i dont know what was going so wrong with it but i had to reinstall it like 5 times. I still don't really even know what was causing the error still but im just glad it's fixed. Also making the video walkthrough for this assignment was kind of hard just because i felt like i kept messing up, i ended up just recording it as fast as i could with some mistakes still but it's only 2 minutes 22 seconds long so i figured it was good enough because you're never going to get a perfect video.
